# assignment1_mda
## Overview
This assignment analyzes a dataset of economic variables at the **CCAA level** through descriptive statistics and matrix analysis techniques. The objective is to practice core concepts in multivariate data analysis, including mean vectors, covariance and correlation matrices, standardization, and eigen decomposition.

## Tasks
The assignment includes the following steps:

1. Compute the **mean vector**.  
2. Construct the **centered data matrix (Xc)** where all columns have mean zero.  
3. Calculate the **cross product matrix (Xpc = Xc’Xc)**.  
4. Derive the **covariance matrix (S)**.  
5. Standardize the dataset to obtain the **standardized data matrix (Xs)**.  
6. Compute the **correlation matrix (R)**.  
7. Perform **eigen decomposition** of both Xc’Xc and S.  
8. Construct the **dispersion matrix** and correlation matrix of Xs.  
9. Obtain **eigenvalues and eigenvectors** of the correlation matrix.  

## Purpose
This project provides hands-on practice with descriptive statistics and linear algebra tools commonly used in multivariate economic data analysis.

## Repository
The repository contains:
- Assignment instructions  
- Code implementation  
- Results and computed matrices
